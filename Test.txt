JAVA TEST:


1.JAVA:
Java is a object oriented programming language and it is platform independent. 


javac : javac is the java compiler
 It executes the  program.


2. JDK:
Java Developmeint kit.
write the program or code.

   

JRE:Java runtimr environment
 execute the progam.
jRE=JDK+Class.libraries.



JVM:java virtual machine 
Actually executes the program.

JVM=Java virtual machine 
Actually  exexutes the program.
JVM=JRE+JKD.


3. Limitations of array
  1.Array is always open and enclose with the  braces []
  2.Index numbers
  3.arrays are within the "" 
  4. In the array index number should be mentioned.
  
  
  
4.
class: class is a blue print /template and describes the object the variables.
 Instaces of the class .
 syntax:
 class A{
 ----data
 
 
 Object:object is a real world entity.
 object is a member of a class(instances of the class)
 
 syntax:
 class_name obj=new class_name();
 
 signiture of the class 
 
 
 
 5.Array:
 array is a collection variablea.
 Array is variable that declare in the braces[].
 
 
 6.
 Difference between .java file .class file 
 .java file:
 .java is for write the code 
 extention is .java
 
 
 
 
 
 
 .class file :
 .class is covert the byte code to the machine language
 

 
7.byte [] data ={12,34,9,0,-62,88}




8.Method ; method is a block of code or varibles.
sytax :
return type class_name()


ex: static void bike();

{

System.out.println("bike is good");
}

9. java;
java is a object oriented programming  or a high level language that converts the byte code to the machine level language.


10.
variables : variables can store the values .


types of variables are:

String : String is text that store the alpabetic words.
             It  is  alaways in the double quoet "" .
	         Example: "Hello world"
	   
Byte:byte is a whole number. it is sufficient with in the range of -128 to  127.

int :int  is a whole number. it is sufficient with in the range of -32,876.

long :long  is storing the  is a whole number. it is sufficient with in the range of 2,34,5678,944.
short :short   is a whole number. it is sufficient with in the range of 923456789.
double: double is storing decimal numbers it is decimal number of 6 to 7
 
char:char is a character stores the letters ,and ASCII values  and char always in the single quoet.



11. class variable 
instaces of the class variables.


12.Datatype :
datatype specifies the  values of the data.

Types datatype:
8-types of  datatypes--
    1.byte
	2.short
	3.int
	4.long
	5.float
	6.double
	7.char
	8.Boolean
	
	1.Byte:-
	 Byte is  storing a whole number. it is store  with in the range of -128 to  127.
	 size is 1byte
	   ex: byte[]={2,3,4};
	   
	   
	 2.short: Short is storing  the whole number .It is store in range    2,34,556,224
	   ex: short ;
	3.int:int is storing is a whole number. it is sufficient with in the range of -32,876.
	       ex: int age;

    4.long :long  is storing the  is a whole number. it is sufficient with in the range of 2,34,5678,944.


    5. float: float is storing   the decimal numbers  it is sufficient to 6 to  7 decimals.
	     size is 4.
		  ex: float a=2.3446;
 
    6.double :float is storing   the decimal numbers  it is sufficient to 10 to  15 decimals.
            size is 8byte.
			ex: double b=2.77896865;
	7. char:char is a character stores the letters ,and ASCII values  and char always in the single quoet
         size is 4byte .
		 
    8.boolean: store the true and  false values.
 
 
 13. java features ;
  1.java is simple and easy to learn.
  2.platform indepent
  3.robust 
  4.compiler and interpretor
  5.
  
  14.types og array 
  1.array list 
  2.linlked list 
  
  
  16.  System.out,println()
  
  System-keyword
  out-static variable 
   . -method_name
   println- println the meeage 
   ()-parameet
   
   
   17.double equal opertaor
     Assign the values.


18.dot operator:
dot opertot is used to address the instaces.
